# Local data model (schemaVersion 1)

One JSON object is stored under `vshape-tracker` in `localStorage`.

- `settings`: selected program week (1–12), daily calorie and protein targets. Defaults reflect `MASTER_PLAN.md`; edits affect the app only.
- `draft`: at most one open workout session. Each saved set persists immediately.
- `sessions[]`: completed sessions. `id`, local `date` (`YYYY-MM-DD`), workout key A/B/C/D, `week`, notes, `updatedAt`, and `sets[]`.
- `sets[]`: stable `id`, exercise index/name snapshot, set number, numeric load, unit (`kg` or `lb`), integer reps, numeric RIR. A snapshot keeps history readable if a future program revision changes names.
- `foods[]`: user-entered food name, serving label, calories, protein, carbs, fat, notes. The user supplies the source values.
- `entries[]`: local date, meal category, servings, food ID and a snapshot of food macros. Editing a food does not rewrite prior entries.
- `checkins[]`: local date, optional weight (kg), waist (cm), sleep (hours), knee observation, notes.

IDs use `crypto.randomUUID()`. Calendar dates use local time; timestamps use ISO UTC. All writes replace the single stored object only after successful serialization. Parse/schema failure stops use of the stored object rather than silently overwriting it. JSON export includes settings, completed sessions, draft, foods, entries and check-ins.

Future Flask/SQLite migration should keep this frontend and replace the persistence boundary in `js/data.js` feature by feature. Map settings first, then sessions/sets, foods/entries, check-ins. Validate and back up the local JSON before any migration; use SQLite foreign keys and parameterized queries. There is no decision yet to start a backend.
